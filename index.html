        <h2>Coloring a mandala using pencil crayons, crayons, paint, or pastels combines the benefits of meditation and art therapy into a simple practice that can be done at any time and place. People who color mandalas often experience a deep sense of calm and well-being.<br>Mandalas bring along a feeling of relaxation

            They help with balance. They bring peace and tranquility. Looking at them will give you a feeling of calmness. They help with concentration .It might seem a little tedious to have to color the same patterns the exact same way over and over. Where’s the creativity in that, right? But actually, this attention to detail is what will make your mandala stand out....</h2>
        <h1>Guitar</h1>

        <h2>It’s often said that music can soothe the soul. Simply listening to music has many benefits, but learning to play an instrument can be even more beneficial. Playing a musical instrument is a brilliant way to express yourself and really focus on something you love. It requires patience, perseverance and dedication. Practicing the guitar regularly can enhance your concentration and expand your attention span. It takes an adequate focus to become an expert guitarist.

            Focusing becomes a habit for your mind and will help you concentrate better on other everyday chores too. </h2>
